See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Project Structure
```
src/
|-- components/
|   |-- Welcome.js
|   |-- QuestionText.js
|   |-- QuestionRanking.js
|   |-- QuestionMedia.js
|   |-- Insights.js
|-- App.js
```

## Components

### Welcome.js
This is the first screen users will see. It should contain a welcome message and a button to start the game. You can use the `Typography` component for the welcome message and the `Button` component for the start button.

### QuestionText.js, QuestionRanking.js, QuestionMedia.js
These are the question components. Each one will be used for a different type of question: text-based multiple choice, ranking, and media-based multiple choice respectively. 

Each question component will receive the question and answer options as props. It will also manage the state of the selected answer. Once an answer is selected, the component will navigate to the next question.

For the multiple choice questions, you can use the `RadioGroup` and `FormControlLabel` components. For the ranking questions, you can use the `Slider` component.

### Insights.js
This is the final screen users will see. It will receive all the answers as props (you can manage this using React's Context API or any state management library like Redux). Based on the answers, it will calculate and display the insights/statistics about the user's ethics beliefs. You can use the `Table` and `TableBody` components to display the insights.

## Navigation
React Router will be used to navigate between the different screens. Each question will have its own route (e.g., "/question1", "/question2", etc.), and there will also be routes for the Welcome screen ("/") and the Insights screen ("/insights").

## State Management
The state of the selected answers will be managed at the top level of the application (in App.js) and passed down to the components that need it via props. Alternatively, you can use a state management library like Redux or the Context API to manage the state.

## Styling
Material-UI provides a way to use CSS-in-JS for styling via its `makeStyles` function. You can define your styles in a JavaScript object and apply them to your components using the `className` prop.

## Testing
Jest and React Testing Library can be used to write unit and integration tests for the components.

## Building and Deployment
The application can be bundled for production using a tool like Webpack or Parcel. It can be deployed on a static site hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
